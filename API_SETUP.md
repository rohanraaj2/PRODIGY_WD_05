## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Your API Key

### Method 1: Direct Edit (Local Development Only)

2. Find line 2: `const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';`
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key

### Method 2: Environment File (Recommended)

   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       API_KEY: 'your_actual_api_key_here'
   };
   ```
3. Update `script.js` to use: `const API_KEY = CONFIG.API_KEY;`
4. Add `config.js` to `.gitignore` (already done)
